Recreation of AfterDarks 2.0 Flying Toasters screensaver for macOS

Dissatisfied with a few of the Flying Toaster screensaver clones that exist for modern macOS, I set off to implement one that felt more true to Berkley Systems After Dark 2.0 version of my youth.
Due to a breadth of legacy and modern hardware in my personal collection, I opted for ObjC as the language here but may chose to modernize this in the future. I've also intentionally omitted collision detection and physics from the design in this initial version. I hope to add it in a subsequent version later and perhaps even add support for similar variety that Berkley Systems did through each of their After Dark Releases.

This project was inspired by Bryan Brauns work on his project, [After Dark CSS](https://github.com/bryanbraun/after-dark-css).
